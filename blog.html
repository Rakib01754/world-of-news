                <p><span class="font-bold">var:</span> <br>
                    The scope of a var variable is functional scope. <br>
                    It can be updated and re-declared into the scope. <br>
                    It can be declared without initialization. <br>
                    It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”. <br>
                    hoisting done , with initializing as ‘default’ value <br> <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">let:</span> <br>
                    The scope of a let variable is block scope. <br>
                    It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. <br>
                    It can be declared without initialization. <br>
                    It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’. <br>
                    Hoisting is done , but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access the let variable
                    before declaration/initialization <br> <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">const:</span> <br>
                    The scope of a const variable is block scope. <br>
                    It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. <br>
                    It cannot be declared without initialization. <br>
                    It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization. <br>
                    Hoisting is done, but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access the const
                    variable before declaration/initialization

                <p>It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate
                    like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain
                    dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">3. Difference Between Normal Function And Arrow Function</h2>
                <p>
                    Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.
                    Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the
                    arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
                    constructor functions.

                    The arrow function example above allows a developer to accomplish the same result with fewer lines
                    of code and approximately half the typing. Curly brackets aren’t required if only one expression is
                    present.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">1. Difference Between map,ForEach,find,filter</h2>
                <p>
                    .forEach: .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not
                    change the array and it returns undefined. Example: In the example below we would use .forEach() to
                    iterate over an array of food and log that we would want to eat each of them. let food =
                    ['mango','rice','pepper','pear']; food.forEach(function(foodItem){ console.log('I want to eat
                    '+foodItem); }); <br><br>

                    .map: executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
                    elements. .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and
                    returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. <br><br>

                    .find: The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find()
                    method
                    executes
                    a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found. The
                    find() method does not execute the function for empty elements. <br><br>

                    .filter: The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a
                    function. The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements. The filter() method
                    does not change the original array. <br><br>
